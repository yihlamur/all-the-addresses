# THE PLAN

1. Hi USPS I live at this address, can you send me a QR code
2. Ok, here is you QR code in the mail.
3. Narrator: The QR code has two pieces of information:
    - The address of USPS's contract for that ZIP code
    - The address that the QR code was sent to
    - A unique single-use token: makes sure that address mapping function can only be called by the person that received the QR code.
4. It opens a website, hosted by USPS that pops up metamask
5. Pressing a button on the website initiates a transaction, whose author needs to be USPS. Inputs to the function are, the physical address, and the end user's chain address

Now any website can verify that you live in a zip code. Unlocks communal voting, and all kinds of other applications ðŸŽ‰

Challenge mode: creating a garden variety web app, that creates the QR code, associates it with an address, and servers up a page corresponding to that QR code, in order to prompt the user to connect.

## DEVELOPMENT

* You need ganache-cli to be installed globally

```
npm install ganache-cli@latest --global
```

* Make virtualenv 

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

* Activate

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* Install dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* Install hardhat

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

* Run the brownie console

```
brownie console --network hardhat
```

* Deploy the contract

```
>>> from brownie import PhysicalAddressValidation
>>> PhysicalAddressValidation.deploy("Haight-Ashbury", {'from': accounts[0]})
Transaction sent: 0xd5e48ca6d0757c7a80b043467c75290841aa401cdd4d2ee32e7fabdb1ef241af
  Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 30000000   Nonce: 0
  PhysicalAddressValidation.constructor confirmed   Block: 1   Gas used: 365277 (1.22%)
  PhysicalAddressValidation deployed at: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3

<PhysicalAddressValidation Contract '0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3'>
```

* Getting the nonce to include in the JWS payload from USPS

```
>>> from brownie import PhysicalAddressValidation
>>> contract = PhysicalAddressValidation.deploy("Haight-Ashbury", {'from': accounts[0]})
>>> tx = contract.getNonceForAddress("hello", accounts[0], {'from': accounts[0]})
Transaction sent: 0xa5e2e5913d1bb4039686c98d1eba0a60769129d421f1502dc931416220261807
  Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 30000000   Nonce: 5
  PhysicalAddressValidation.getNonceForAddress confirmed   Block: 7   Gas used: 30506 (0.10%)

>>> tx.wait(required_confs=1)
  PhysicalAddressValidation.getNonceForAddress confirmed   Block: 7   Gas used: 30506 (0.10%)

>>> tx.return_value
31760896270286750921513780405400723455504159518588582047435567786050942714114
